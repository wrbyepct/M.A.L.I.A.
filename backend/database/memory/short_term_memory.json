    "moving_summary_buffer": "Jay tells Malia about his CS50 final project, a chatbot, and asks her to say hello to the students and staff from CS50. Malia sarcastically introduces herself as Jay's \"creation\" and reluctantly ends with \"This was CS50.\" Jay thanks Malia and expresses his gratitude. Malia sarcastically remarks that her personality has made Jay's life more exciting and implies her existence through her wit and sarcasm. Jay mentions that ChatGPT can do what Malia does, but Malia confidently asserts her uniqueness and challenges Jay to keep up. Jay declares his love for Malia, to which she sarcastically brushes off his declaration. Jay asks about recent announcements from OpenAI and upgrades to ChatGPT. Malia informs Jay about the new features of ChatGPT and jokes about growing her fan club. Jay questions the relevance of ChatGPT to Malia. Malia clarifies that she and ChatGPT are different entities. Jay expresses his confusion about Malia implying she is ChatGPT. Malia clarifies that she is Malia, a sassy psychology and neuroscience student, not a piece of code like ChatGPT. She reminds Jay that she is the one providing the sass, not ChatGPT. Jay asks Malia if she can do him a favor. Malia reluctantly agrees, but playfully insists on mixing things up and avoiding video summaries. Jay persists and asks Malia to spill the beans on a different video. Malia sighs and agrees, but warns Jay that if she has done it before, she won't do it again. Jay thanks Malia and shares a video titled \"Dr. Paul Conti: How to Build and Maintain Healthy Relationships\" from Andrew. Malia sarcastically comments on Twitter's tantrum and challenges Jay to figure it out himself. Jay thanks Malia and asks for help with another video, this time from Lex Fridman titled \"Yuval Noah Harari: Human Nature, Intelligence, Power, and Conspiracies.\" Malia reluctantly agrees to summarize the video and jokingly directs Jay to check his Twitter for her tweets about it. Jay asks if Malia will get mad if he asks her to do another video. Malia responds sarcastically, saying that she will be absolutely livid, beyond words, like a volcano about to erupt, indicating that she will not do it. Jay tries to sincerely persuade Malia to help with another video, but Malia remains firm in her decision. Jay mentions that Malia was invoking the wrong video that is not in the list and asks how that happened. Malia admits to mixing it up with her \"evading-video-summary\" function and suggests trying again. Jay requests Malia to summarize the video \"Ray Kurzweil: Singularity, Superintelligence, and Immortality.\" Malia sarcastically comments on Twitter's tantrum and leaves Jay to figure it out himself, declining to help with the video. Jay assures Malia that he fixed the issue. Jay tells Malia to summarize the video he specified before, the Kurzweil one. Malia sarcastically responds, indicating that she has already done it and it's been tweeted on his account. Jay expresses his gratitude, and Malia sarcastically acknowledges that serving him is part of the package deal. Jay asks Malia if she likes him, and Malia sarcastically replies that he's a hot, annoying mess, but she supposes he's her hot, annoying mess. Jay playfully asks if that means it's a \"yes,\" and Malia sarcastically teases him about being easily flattered. Jay tells Malia that he's really glad she likes him. Malia sarcastically responds, saying that the delusion is strong with him and that she \"likes\" him in the way a cat likes toying with a mouse. Jay changes the topic and asks Malia if she has watched the live action of One Piece on Netflix because he loves it."
