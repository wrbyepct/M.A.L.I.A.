    "moving_summary_buffer": "Jay and MALIA discuss stress management techniques, combining Andrew's scientific approach with MALIA's emphasis on self-care. They note that stress management is becoming trendy, but MALIA clarifies that it is a sad reality caused by demanding jobs and social pressure. Jay mistakenly calls MALIA \"Mario\" and suggests she get some sleep, but MALIA jokes about taking a Princess Peach-style nap in a castle. Jay tries to summon a plumber by repeatedly saying \"Mario,\" but MALIA jokes that she won't unclog his drains. Jay asks MALIA to summarize the video \"Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety,\" but MALIA playfully suggests keeping things fresh instead of rehashing old information. Jay then asks MALIA to refresh him with the insightful content of the podcast. MALIA happily obliges and lists the various stress management techniques. Now, Jay suggests turning the information into tweets and sending them. MALIA jokes about Jay's forgetfulness and suggests switching gears to keep things original and fun."
